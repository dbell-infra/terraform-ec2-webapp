# Terraform EC2 Webapp 

This repo will build an example web application running on EC2 instances via an Autoscalling Group

The repo references a network module that builds out a VPC and new subnets to deploy instances into 

EC2 instances are bootstrapped via userdata, and run a simple python HTTP server

## Deployment 
For simplicity the codebase uses default var values in a variables.tf, to update the configuration pass new values into variables.tf

By default the codebase deploys the following:

````
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
